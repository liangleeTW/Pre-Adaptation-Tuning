	A fundamental challenge in sensorimotor learning is deciding how strongly observed errors should drive updating under sensory uncertainty. Consider an archer observing an arrow land slightly to the left of the bullseye. Faced with this outcome, the observer may either treat the miss as reliable evidence of a motor error and markedly shift the aim, or instead attribute the same error to external instability and adjust only minimally. Yet, as perception is inherently noisy, evaluating the causal relevance of an error requires inference under uncertainty. Suppose two archers differ in how clearly they sense their own movements (proprioceptive precision), one a novice with a coarse bodily sense (low precision) whereas the other an expert with a refined one (high precision). Given the same error, these differences in perceptual uncertainty could shape how the discrepancy is explained, either more in terms of one’s own body or the external world.
	Although sensory precision is known to shape how prediction errors influence learning (Kording & Wolpert, 2004; Burge et al., 2008), how exactly it modulates the processing of prediction errors remains an open question. Prior work indicates that this influence can unfold through computationally distinct routes (Kording et al., 2007; Wei & Kording, 2009). In the classical reliability-based route, prediction errors are weighted in proportion to sensory precision. Under this view, higher precision implies a more reliable signal, thereby increasing the weight assigned to prediction errors in the ensuing state update (Burge et al., 2008). However, the precision of a sensory channel does not guarantee that the information it conveys is veridical, as highly precise signals can still be systematically distorted by external perturbations (Redding et al., 2005; Rohde et al., 2011). This motivates an alternative source-estimation account, where prediction errors are assessed for their causal relevance. Under this account, higher precision sharpens the attribution boundary between internal variability and external perturbations, potentially increasing the tendency to attribute discrepancies to external causes and thus regulating how prediction errors are integrated into updating (Wei & Körding, 2009). Taken together, while these frameworks converge on the importance of sensory precision, they diverge in predicting whether high precision serves to enhance the impact of prediction errors on learning or to limit their effective influence when discrepancies are attributed to external causes.
	In sensorimotor research, visual signals serve as a widely used model system, given that their noise statistics permit a direct mapping to estimates of sensory reliability (Ernst & Banks, 2002). In contrast, despite being the critical counterpart for state estimation, proprioception is less frequently manipulated, as independently parametrizing its uncertainty without concomitantly altering motor dynamics remains methodologically challenging. Consequently, sensorimotor recalibration studies strategically adopted spatial configurations that dissociate visual feedback from the limb’s proprioceptive reference frame. These configurations foreground visual feedback, prioritizing it over proprioceptive feedback during calibration (Burge et al., 2008). In this context, holding proprioceptive precision fixed provides a reasonable and tractable approximation, enabling researchers to isolate sensory reweighting effects in response to visual reliability. However, this focus has implicitly treated proprioception as a fixed parameter, potentially overlooking the plasticity of proprioceptive precision and its implications for error processing.
	Under the framework of active inference, sensory precision is not a static intrinsic property, but a context-dependent parameter subject to endogenous modulation (Friston, 2010; Feldman & Friston, 2010). To minimize uncertainty and optimize state estimation, the brain is assumed to dynamically allocate precision to the most reliable sensory channels (Parr & Friston, 2017). Consequently, when the availability of visual information is compromised, intrinsic proprioceptive precision is predicted to be upregulated to optimize the spatial representation of the limb (Limanowski & Friston, 2020; Sober & Sabes, 2003). This theoretical perspective offers a plausible mechanism to titrate proprioceptive precision via task design alone, without the confound of altering motor dynamics. Yet, it remains unclear whether proprioceptive precision can be titrated via sensory contexts, and how the resulting pre-shaped precision profiles modulate error processing when encountering novel perturbations.	
	To address this, we capitalized on the prism adaptation paradigm (Redding et al., 2005) and focused on the pre-adaptation phase, where we modulated visual availability during reaching to differentially sharpen or blunt proprioceptive precision (Fiehler et al., 2023). While precluding direct view of the reaching limb, we established three sensory contexts based on the availability of ambient visual information: Eyes Open with Ambient Vision (EO+), Eyes Open with Ambient Vision Masked (EO-), and Eyes Closed (EC). These three contexts delineate a hierarchy of visual availability that shapes proprioceptive contribution during reaching. Thus, this design allows us to test how the proprioceptive precision profiles established during this tuning phase shape subsequent prism adaptation dynamics.
